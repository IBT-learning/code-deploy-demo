1. Download this repo on your local machine
2. Zip it and upload it to S3 
3. Launch an EC2 instance with public DNS
a. Configure Security Group to recive all traffic on port 22
b. Create tag for this EC2 instance
c. Attach IAM role to this EC2 to interact with Codedeploy
4. Install code deploy agent on the machine - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/codedeploy-agent-operations-install-linux.html
5. Upload your zip file to S3 and attach a role to allow access to Codedeploy by attaching below bucket policy
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:Get*",
                "s3:List*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET_NAME>/*",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": [
                    "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNTID>:role/CodeDeployDemo"
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
6. Follow below steps to create deployment from console.
Before you use the CodeDeploy console to deploy your application revision, you need a service role ARN. A service role is an IAM role that gives a service permission to act on your behalf. In this case, the service role gives CodeDeploy permission to access your Amazon EC2 instances to expand (read) their Amazon EC2 instance tags.
You should have already followed the instructions in Create a service role (console) to create a service role. To get the ARN of the service role, see Get the service role ARN (console) .
Now that you have the ARN, use the CodeDeploy console to deploy your application revision:
Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CodeDeploy console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy.
In the navigation pane, expand Deploy, then choose Applications.
In the list of applications, choose WordPress_App.
On the Deployment groups tab, choose Create deployment group.
In Deployment group name, enter WordPress_DepGroup.
Under Deployment type, choose In-place deployment.
In Environment configuration, select Amazon EC2 instances.
In Agent configuration with AWS Systems Manager, keep the defaults.
In Key, enter Name.
In Value, enter CodeDeployDemo.
In Deployment configuration, choose CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime.
In Service role ARN, choose the service role ARN, and then choose Create deployment group.
Choose Create deployment.
In Deployment group choose WordPress_DepGroup.
Next to Repository type, choose My application is stored in Amazon S3. In Revision location, enter the location of the sample WordPress application revision you previously uploaded to Amazon S3. To get the location:
Open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.
In the list of buckets, choose codedeploydemobucket (or the name of the bucket where you uploaded your application revision).
In the list of objects, choose WordPressApp.zip.
On the Overview tab, copy the value of the Link field to your clipboard.
It might look something like this:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/codedeploydemobucket/WordPressApp.zip
Return to the CodeDeploy console, and in Revision location, paste the Link field value.
If a message appears in the File type list stating the file type could not be detected, choose .zip.
(Optional) Type a comment in the Deployment description box.
Expand Deployment group overrides, and from Deployment configuration, choose CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime.
Choose Start deployment. Information about your newly created deployment appears on the Deployments page.
